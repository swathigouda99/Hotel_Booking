# Hotel-Booking-Analysis

## Problem Statement
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!

This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

So, objective here is to explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.

## Project Approach
Who does not like to travel and spend some quality vacation in a good & snuggly hotel ? Surely, maximum people out there would love to go for a vacation and enjoy their stay in a good hotel. So, basically hotels play an essential part in the overall vacation experience. With the growth in travel and tourism, ‘Hotel Industry’ which comes under ‘Hospitality Industry’ is also scaling up and of course a large number of factors remain responsible for the success of this industry and one of those are the booking pattern of hotels. So, here I have a dataset regarding the data of hotel bookings and related information. With all this data, I managed to analyze and extract some meaningful insights from it.
Following are the steps taken to carry out exploratory data analysis:
* Downloaded the data and had a glimpse of all the feature that the dataset contains with the help of pandas library.
* Checked for missing and null values.
* Dealt with few missing and null values so as to make the dataset clean and ready to perform data analysis.
* Performed exploratory data analysis by visualising different variable or features with the help of matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
* Came up with some meaningful insights that the hotels can consider, in order to target the new customers to increase revenue and also maintain good relations with     the existing customers.
